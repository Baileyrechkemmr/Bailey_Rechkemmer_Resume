<!-- i started with making a html sheet for each of my page link.

affter that i creatted a sytle.css file and conected it to each of the html files <head> tag -->

<!-- from their i made a basic boiler plate for all the html sheets as well as went to https://getbootstrap.com/ in order to get the jquery script to make my coade work -->

<!-- i then made a app.js file and went through and conected it to all the html files and then put the scripts in the proper places. after that i added a div and called it the nav bar and conected each link in the nav bar to the proper html pages and alowwing you to just click inbetween them.-->

<!-- next was adding all the divs and list items as well as all the <p> scripts -->
