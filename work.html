            <li>SPACE BATTLE hw</li>
                <p id="elementText">This was a space battle in which the computer made 6 ships with random hull strength, fire power, and accuracy. Your goal was to defeat all alien ships and save earth. In this assignment I had more trouble than I thought I would in making a random array of ships and honestly would have made me quit. Only this stuff also made me more intrigued than anything else.</p>
            <li>LANDSCAPING SIMULATER hw</li>
                <p id="elementText">This was a more complicated assignment as we had to make more functions and callbacks than the other games we had as
                home work. as well as learning new ways to get the code to work in a DRY way. This also was a fun way to really hit home
                the lessons and get in practice.</p>
            <li>WOOD TURNED LAMP</li>
                <p id="elementText">This was a simple woodworking project I did, it reminded me of building the website however. putting together the slabs
                of wood and removing what isn't needed to get something beautiful.
