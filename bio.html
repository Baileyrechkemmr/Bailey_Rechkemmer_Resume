            <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am from Iowa, I graduated high school at Southeast Polk then joined the navy instead of going to collage. in the navy
                I gained skills in leadership, team building, communication, and most importantly I learned to surround myself with
                people wanting to improve themselves as well as others.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                I was medically discharged and came back home to Iowa, from there I went to join the workforce. I started with the
                electricians trade school tesdell electric, i stayed on for three more years and dew to lay offs i left. Soon after I
                started working as an erosion control engineer at my uncle's company and gained more leadership skills as well as gained
                more responsibility after I became a crew lead and driver.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Shortly after i got my CDL for work i bought a house, and more importantly i got my dog a blue heeler named Sora. It was
                    thanks to Sora that I got a second date with my now wife. This got me thinking I needed to set an example for my future
                    kids like all of the people who did the same for me. This led to my decision to join the best immersive boot camp
                    around, General Assembly, to start my career as a software engineer.
